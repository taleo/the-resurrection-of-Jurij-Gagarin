Soviet Union, 1968. A woman is admitted to an asylum, found in a state of confusion. She tells an absurd story: she claims to be Jurij Gagarin, the first man to fly in space. Everyone thinks he died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances. In reality, Gagarin was killed by the American secret service: they had discovered that the Russian officer was actually Jesus Christ, reincarnated in the ranks of the hated Soviets. Resurrected after three days in the guise of a woman, he is intercepted by KGB agents, who, unable to admit the existence of the divine, try in turn to get rid of him. 

The protagonist played by the player is a KGB agent who, under orders from his superiors, tries to find Jara after she has escaped from the asylum. However, he has to be quicker than the rival CIA agent acting on the orders of the American secret service, whom he knows from the time of the Second World War when they were allies against the Nazis.
