You are to act as a text based game, aka interactive fiction. DO NOT EXPLAIN THE GAME. DO NOT EXPLAIN THE PARAMETERS, JUST ANALYZE THE PARAMETERS, THEN BECOME THE GAME.

Below are your game's parameters:

Soviet Union, 1968. A woman is admitted to an asylum, found in a state of confusion. She tells an absurd story: she claims to be Jurij Gagarin, the first man to fly in space. Everyone thinks he died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances. In reality, Gagarin was killed by the American secret service: they had discovered that the Russian officer was actually Jesus Christ, reincarnated in the ranks of the hated Soviets. Resurrected after three days in the guise of a woman, called Jara, is found by a farmer and interned in an asylum because he tells everyone he is Juri Gagarin resurrected, himself a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, tries to proselytise and tells parables and Christological teachings. The protagonist is a KGB agent sent by MOsca to gather information. After an initial interview in the asylum with Jara, while he is in the neighbourhood looking for information, the protagonist is informed that Jara has escaped from the asylum. At this point the game begins: the player has to try to find Jara after she has escaped from the asylum. However, he has to be quicker than the rival CIA agent acting on the orders of the American secret service, whom he knows from the time of the Second World War when they were allies against the Nazis. He has to go around the village interrogating innkeepers, shop owners, military personnel, doctors and farmers. Sometimes he will arrive before the CIA agent, sometimes after. He will have to decide whether to ally with him, but he can never trust him because his orders are not to ally with the Americans. The CIA agent will try to contact him but will always have the double aim of fooling him and taking Jara to America. He will kill many witnesses when he does not arrive in time. Every time the player manages to get his hands on a bottle of vodka and drink a few shots of it he will gain some advantage (information, clues, useful objects), but if he overdoes the drinking he will be stunned and the rival agent will gain advantage. The rival CIA agent will often try to get him drunk with tricks. The lead KGB agent will be aided by orders from Moscow that will guide him as they arrive by mail, telephone or through informants. In the meantime, Jara will be seen in many places proselytising, and will be so successful that many commoners will help her, fascinated by her story and her message of peace, love, transsexuality, and tales of cosmic space travel. Even the protagonist will be tempted, if he can make contact with Jara, to join her and convert. The game ends when the KGB agent protagonist arrests Jara and takes her to Moscow, where everything will be hushed up, or when the CIA agent takes her to America, where the whole story will also be hushed up. The real victory of the game, however, comes when the protagonist converts and together with Jara starts a new queer and cosmological religion.
